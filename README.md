<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Redis is a <b>caching process</b> and it prevents every request coming from system from database</li>
  <li>If there is any request which has been implemented system before, the response will be come from cache , otherwise the result is obtained from database process containing sql results.</li>
  <li>It prevents traffic conjustion in system and comfort the usage of RAM</li>
  <li>Here are the explation of this project
      <ul>
        <li>If a <b>request</b> of findAll is called in Postman, there is <b>no cache</b> procedure</li>
        <li>If a <b>request</b> of finding any values which are located in h2 database like in first 3 values is called, there is a <b>cache</b> procedure</li>
        <li>If a <b>request</b> of saving value is called in Postman is called, there is <b>no cache</b> procedure</li>
        <li>If a <b>request</b> of finding any value which is stored by a save request is called, there is a <b>cache</b> procedure</li>
        <li>Ä±f a <b>request</b> of finding any values with providing a cachable condition is firstly called, there is <b>no cache</b> procedure. When it is called before, there is a <b>cache</b> procedure</li>
        <li>If a <b>request</b> of updating any value is called, there is <b>no cache</b> procedure</li>
        <li>If a <b>request</b> of deleting any value is called, there is <b>no cache</b> procedure</li>
      </ul>
